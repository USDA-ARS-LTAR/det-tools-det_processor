    "site": "Nitrogen Rate Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in Fort Collins, Colorado",
    "description": "Nitrogen fertilization is essential for optimizing crop yields; however, it increases N2O emissions. These emissions were monitored from several irrigated cropping systems receiving N fertilizer rates ranging from 0-246 kg/ha from years 2002-2006. Cropping systems included conventional-till continuous corn and no-till continuous corn at varying N rates. Nitrous oxide fluxes were measured during four growing seasons using static, vented chambers and a gas chromatograph analyzer.  This work shows that the use of no-till can potentially reduce N2O emissions from irrigated systems and increase soil carbon storage."
